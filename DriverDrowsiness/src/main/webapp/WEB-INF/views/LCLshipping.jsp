					<h2>
						Difference Between <br>LCL &amp; FCL
					</h2>
					<p>FCL (Full Container Load) and LCL (Less Container Load) are
						terms used in international sea freight transportation. FCL and
						LCL are different both by definition and practice. If you need to
						transport a small cargo that can not be sent by regular post, but
						the cost of air freight is already prohibitively high for such
						cargo, and for transporting the whole container it is still too
						small, then sending the combined cargo is what you need.</p>

					<p>According to the world standard, if the volume of the

						20-foot standard container has a volume of 33.2m3), a combined
						shipment â€“ LCL applied.</p>

					<h3>How it works?</h3>
					<p>Let's say you found an attractive item on the Chinese
						portal, bought it - and now you need to deliver it to your city.
						You make an application for delivery, and we immediately contact
						our agents abroad in the nearest city from the place of dispatch.
						They take the cargo from your seller and send it to the cargo
						consolidation warehouse. In this warehouse, dispatch of containers
						is formed all over the world, including to the countries of Europe
						and the CIS. Cargo consolidation is not an easy process. The
						company that you trust the delivery must have experience in this
						area, since they need to arrange all stages of transportation.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="description-block_card right-card">
					<h3>Use of LCL</h3>
					<p>When transporting a consolidated cargo, you do not need to
						worry about returning the container after its delivery. Since
						along with your cargo in the container the goods of other shippers
						are transported, the return of the container becomes a problem of
						the container line. Senders of LCL need only worry about the cargo
						that is to be transported, and more about nothing. It should be
						noted that dangerous goods are never accepted for the transport of
						consolidated cargoes (falling under the IMO classification and
						having UN number - that is, flammable, combustible, explosive,
						radioactive, etc.)</p>

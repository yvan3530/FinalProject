				<p>FCL (Full Container Load) – is an ocean shipping mode, in
					which the entire container is intended for one supplier and
					occupies a full container (regardless of size). FCL transportation
					can be filled directly at the supplier’s warehouse, and then sent
					to the container yard (container cargo station in the port). The
					container can be unloaded at the port of destination or the carrier
					can deliver to the recipient's warehouse.</p>

					<h2>The difference between container transportation and
						carriage in bulk</h2>
					<p>More than 80% of everything we eat, wear, and use is shipped
						by sea. Since the 1950s, container shipping has become very
						popular among shippers due to their standardization and
						efficiency. Container transportation allows for uninterrupted
						delivery of cargo from the consignor to the consignee, thereby
						reducing the volume of intermediate transshipment operations.</p>

			<p class="block-description">The main drawback of containers is
				the need for their return. This refers to the return of empty
				containers that could not be occupied with return freight. On
				average, these returns account for 15% of the total number of
				containers transported by the ship. Obviously, this is an additional
				cost. But the cons are more than offset by the benefits.</p>

					<h3>Transportation of general cargoes</h3>
					<p>For relatively large quantities of goods, it is more
						advantageous to use a certain number of containers than to
						transport cargo on board the vessel. Before the beginning of
						containerization, general cargoes were transported separately on
						board ships. Loading / unloading for general cargoes is more labor
						and time consuming . With coming of containers, the process of
						transporting this type of goods was strongly optimized.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="description-block_card right-card">
					<h3>Transportation of non-standard cargoes</h3>
					<p>Temperature sensitive goods are transported in refrigerated
						containers. There are also specialized solutions for oversized,
						heavy, liquid, loose and other loads, and almost all of this - in
						standard sizes of 20 and 40-foot containers. Thus, container
						transportation is very relevant for trading companies, whose
						international business is built on regular shipments.</p>

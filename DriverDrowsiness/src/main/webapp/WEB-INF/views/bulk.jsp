				<li class="bulk_text-part-card">The proposal of the most
					efficient and economical way of delivering your cargo is always the
					most urgent issue for a logistics company. For shipment that, based
					on the route, quantity of cargo and other conditions, are most
					efficiently transported by the ships, at SeaRates we have combined
					the capabilities of first-class Shipowners, Shipping Agencies and
					Ship Brokers in different countries of the world to provide a full
					range of ship forwarding services in any ports of the world, as
					well as ship chartering. The freight market remains the most
					conservative in the industry, and a key role is always played by
					professionals with a reputation and proficiency. Based on the
					experience of professionals in the field of chartering with great
					practical skills, as well as the most modern methods of digital and
					mathematical modeling in place with statistical algorithms.</li>
				<li class="bulk_text-part-card">We manage to provide the most
					competitive freight rates and the optimal options for
					transportation of various types of cargo in ship lots, including
					vehicles and oversized equipment. In some regions of short-sea
					navigation, general cargo transportation by vessels has lost its
					relevance due to its laboriousness, and container transportation
					has come to replace it, which in this case often turns out to be
					even cheaper than ship lots. Nevertheless, when the volume of the
					cargo exceeds 2,000 tons, the carriage in bulk again acquires its
					relevance, but for its implementation it is necessary to have a
					special qualification. Not to mention lots of over 50,000 tons
					(Supramax vessels type), 70,000 tons (Panamax type) and 100,000
					tons (Capesize type).</li>

					<h3>Legal basis of transportation by ships</h3>
					<p>All ships carrying grain in bulk must have on board the
						relevant documentation developed in accordance with the
						requirements of Chapter 6 of the SOLAS-74 Convention (the
						"International Grain Code") and the Rules of the Register.
						Transportation of bulk cargoes in international shipping is
						regulated by the Code of Safe Practice for the Transport of Solid
						Bulk Cargoes, which have an advisory character, and the
						Intra-Union Rules for the Safe Transport of Non-grain Bulk Cargoes
						(RTM 310038-78). There are also a number of Standards,
						International Conventions and Regulations that are directly
						related to the goods carried on board and regulate them. Among
						them - SOLAS, MARPOL, IMDG Code, standard Gencon, Nype, Synacomex
						and many others, without understanding which the organization and
						support of any transportation is impossible for both the shipowner
						and the charterer.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="description-block_card right-card">
					<h3>Classification of bulk cargoes</h3>
					<p>Bulk cargo, in terms of normalizing the conditions for their
						transportation, are divided into two groups: non-grain and grain.
						Non-grain includes goods transported in bulk: ore, ore
						concentrates, coal, building materials, salt, raw sugar, grain,
						etc. All these loads consist of homogeneous or inhomogeneous
						particles of limited size. ll grain cargoes are divided into three
						groups: cereals, legumes and oilseeds. Physical properties:
						flowability, shrinkage, density, borehole, thermal conductivity
						and sorption properties. Biological properties: grain respiration,
						ripening, germination, self-warming, etc. The carrier must take
						into account all the specified properties of the cargo and ensure,
						firstly, rational loading and safe navigation of the ship;
						secondly, the safety of the goods carried.</p>
